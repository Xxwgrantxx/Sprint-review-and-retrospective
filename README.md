# Sprint-review-and-retrospective

1.	How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
	I interpret user needs based off the answers they give. The more information is given, the more precise the program implementation. Creating user stories allows the users needs to be organized in a way that you can systematically go through these needs until they are all met. 
2.	How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
	The main process that has stood out to me is daily standups and the use of scrum boards. I have already started to incorporate the use of asking myself what I have accomplished, what I need to get accomplished and what are my obstacles. this will allow me to work more effectively as an individual and when I am eventually on a team.
3.	What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
	A good team member is one that understands that everything they do affect the team. You must carry out your roll to your full potential. You must also ask questions to keep the sprint rolling. If you sit on an issue, it will eventually come out when its too late and have more of a detrimental effect on the team. If the team suffers then project suffers with it. Taking care of you team is taking care of yourself. When the team doesn’t have to worry about itself having issues, it can put all its focus on the product.
